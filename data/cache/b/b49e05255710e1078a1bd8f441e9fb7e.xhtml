<p>

The roles of models, views and controllers are quite strict, in the sense that they don&#039;t do inter-object communication themselves:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Model: A model just describes the layout of data and shouldn&#039;t contain functionality that doesn&#039;t deal directly with the model itself</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> View: A view is an object describing how a particular view should look like, and contains functionality to deal with displaying data.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Controller: A controller is an object describing what actions should be taken and contain the main functionality of the application.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

These objects communicate mainly through bindings, which explains why they normally only have to deal with internal matters.
